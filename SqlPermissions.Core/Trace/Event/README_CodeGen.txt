Unlike code generation in other namespaces, code generation in Trace.Event uses the EventClassesGeneration.xml as the source of generated data. This is because some of the data is manually updated. To regenerate code, run the queries in the EventClassesGeneration.xml comment. The results can be entered into the appropriate sections of the XML file and then fixed up as appropriate. In particular, MemberName and ClassName must meet the .Net requirements for token names. To save renaming a lot of stuff, existing event classes should maintain the same name or the partial class that is code gen'd won't match the ones already implemented. For new audit classes, the name can be arbitrary but should closely match the SQL name fixed up to meet naming requirements.
